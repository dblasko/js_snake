## Test it live ! 🚀
The CI (Github Actions) should ensure that a version of the project is currently running **[HERE](http://51.77.193.23:8000/)**.

However, if you want to try running the project locally or if the live version is down, please refer to the *Running the project* section below.


## Running the project 💻

* Clone the project on your machine.
* Open a terminal at the root of the project folder.
